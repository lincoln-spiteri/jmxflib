= Introduction =

Jmxflib works for a limited set of mxf files right now since mxf spec is gigantic and ambiguous 

= Example =

start with the following code:
{{{
SeekableInputStream in = new SeekableFileInputStream(new File("hello_world.mxf"));
MxfStructure structure = MxfStructure.readStructure(in);
}}}

MxfStructure is pretty much mxf headers converted to java objects, to get meaningful high level data you should query the appropriate headers e.g. to get stored dimension of video file

{{{
GenericPictureEssenceDescriptor pic = structure.getPictureEssenceDescriptor();
stored = pic.getStoredDimension();
display = pic.getDisplayRectangle();
}}}
